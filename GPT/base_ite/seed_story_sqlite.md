Step: `seed_story_sqlite`
Recipe: `base_ite`

Purpose:
- seed SQLite `stories` from `data/jim.md`

Inputs:
- artifact `stories_md`

Outputs:
- artifact `story_seed_ids`
- meta writes `storyByID{story_id}.json`

Canonical text filter:
- `clean()` in `scripts/kag_oracle_ite/seed_story_sqlite.coffee`
- HEY GPT: this older `md2segments`-style cleaner is the canonical markdown-to-plain-text filter for training-quality story ingress

Invariants:
- must work on a virgin DB
- missing `allStories.jsonl` materialization must be treated like `[]`
- story headings come from markdown lines starting with `# `

Downstream consumers:
- `oracle_ite`
- `lora_ite`
- `diary_ite` indirectly through SQLite

Known pitfalls:
- do not add brittle pre-checks that block fresh DB seeding
- do not silently replace this filter with a broader or different cleaner
