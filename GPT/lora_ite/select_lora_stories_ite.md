Step: `select_lora_stories_ite`
Recipe: `lora_ite`

Purpose:
- pick the next batch of stories for LoRA training

Inputs:
- meta read `loraStoryUsage.jsonl`
- artifact `lora_cycle_state` via `peek`

Outputs:
- artifact `selected_story_ids`
- artifact `lora_remaining_count`
- artifact `lora_cycle_state`
- possible meta write `loraCycleReset.json`
- possible meta write `pipeline:shutdown`

Selection rule:
- select stories with `use_count <= 0`

Cycle rule:
- when no stories remain, mark cycle complete and shutdown cleanly
- on the next fresh start with `ready_for_reset`, reset LoRA usage and start a full retrain

Invariants:
- fresh DB should still run if `stories` exist and LoRA tables are empty
- `lora_remaining_count` is the UI-facing remaining count

Known pitfalls:
- if `stories` is empty, this step will correctly find nothing to train
- that usually means `base_ite` seeding failed upstream
